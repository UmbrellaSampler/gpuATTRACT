DESCRIPTION
This package contains
	1.) Attract-Scoring-Server-library
	  	A (shared) library for Scoring calculations on the CPU and GPU. 
 	2.) scATTRACT
	  	Client that performs scoring. It uses the Attract-Server-library. 
	3.) mcATTRACT
	  	Client that performs a Monte-Carlo search. It uses the Attract-Server-library.
	4.) emATTRACT (does not work in mcEnsemble branch)
	  	Client that performs a energy minimization by various applicable optimization techniques. It uses the Attract-Server-library.

INSTALLATION
	
Pre-installation steps:
	Install the cuda-toolkit of version >= 6.5 (we have 6.5).
		Make sure that the following environment variables are set:
		
		export CUDADIR=path/to/cuda-toolkit #e.g. /usr/local/cuda 
		export PATH=$CUDADIR/bin:$PATH
		export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CUDADIR/lib64
	

Installation of package:
	Build the package using the makefile in the root directory (gpuATTRACT).

		e.g.
		Build all binaries in RELEASE (default) mode:	
			make (-j#) "or" make TARGET=RELEASE (-j#)
	
		Compile the mcClient in DEBUG mode:
			make mc TARGET=DEBUG (-j#)

		For more information type
			make help

	To enable runtime library binding:
	
	Soft links to the target executables and library is placed in gpuATTRACT/bin/ .
	In order to use executables in scripts/cmd-line:

		export ASDIR=your_path/gpuATTRACT/bin
		export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$ASDIR
